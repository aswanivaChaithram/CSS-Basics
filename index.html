        <p class="para">We all love our parents.  
            Parents are those by whom we are taken care of.
             A child has a mother and a father; the female
              parent of the children is termed as a mother.
               No word or sentence in the world can define 
               the word “Mother” completely. Today, we will
                discuss mother, a topic that will always 
                remain incomplete because it is very hard
                 to describe her in words.</p>
